# Ensemble internal
> The core components of Ensemble.

The `ensemble-internal` package provides the low-level functionality that is the foundation of the Ensemble library. Ensemble uses an object management class to provide some advanced features such as class and class instance extension, simplifying argument validation, and exception generation. Outside of the exceptions, you will not interact directly with any class within the `ensemble-internal` classes.
