# Contributing

> :+1: First off, thank you for contributing.

Accepting contributions is difficult for some, like us, as at its heart is the truth that we aren't perfect, 
either in our imagining the final result or the implementation of a project. So we turn to you...

__We'll say it, we need help _(sometimes)___. We need help tracking down bugs and resolving them. We also need help coming up with ways to improve our projects.
And most times, a fresh un-biased set of eyes is what it takes to get it done.

So here's what you can do to help out.

## Bug reporting
**Found a bug?** Here are a few things we'd like you to do first...

* __Review the FAQs for a list of common questions and problems.__ Sometimes a solution can be found there.
* __Check if you are using the latest version of Ensemble Internal.__ We may have already fixed the issue.
* __Check to see if the bug has already been reported.__ Check [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bs3tech/ensemble-internal/issues).

### Writing great bug reports
Once you've determined that you have a new un-reported, un-resolved bug, [create an issue](https://github.com/bs3tech/ensemble-internal/issues/new) and provide the following:

* __A brief description of the bug.__ Use a clear descriptive title to add relevance to the bug report.
* __Describe the expected behavior and why it was expected.__
* __Describe the actual behavior.__
* __Detail the steps you took to reproduce the bug.__ The more details here, the better chance we have of reproducing the problem.
* __Provide the OS, OS version, PHP version, and environment in which the bug occurs.__ This will give us a chance to simulate your environment.
* __Provide whether the issue occurs itermittenly or is consistently reproducable.__ This helps us more than you'd expect.
* __Anything else that may be relevant to the bug report.__ There is no such thing as too much detail, only incomprehensible detail.

or better yet, use this template, replace everything in braces (`[]`) with the information requested:

#### Bug report template
```
[Brief summary of the issue...]

### Expected behavior
[Description of the expected behavior...]

### Actual behavior
[Description of the actual behavior...]

### Steps to reproduce
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step ...]

### Other information
* **OS & Version:** [OS and OS version...]
* **PHP Version:** [PHP version...]
* **Running in CLI?:** [Yes/No]
* **Happens itermittenly?:** [Yes/No]

### Additional information
[ Anything that you believe may help resolve the issue sooner,
  including screenshots, GIFs, suggested resolutions, pull
  requests, etc...]
```

## Feature requests
**Got an idea that will improve Ensemble Internal?** Great, but first we'd like you to do the following:

* __Check if you are using the latest version of Ensemble Internal.__ We may have already added the feature.
* __Check to see if the feature has already been requested.__ Check [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bs3tech/ensemble-internal/issues).

### Writing great feature requests
Once you've determined that you have a new un-requested, un-implemented feature, [create an issue](https://github.com/bs3tech/ensemble-internal/issues/new) and provide the following:

* __A brief description of the feature.__ Use a clear descriptive title to add relevance to the feature request.
* __Describe the current behavior of the feature, if any.__
* __Describe the suggested behavior of the feature.__
* __Detail the steps that best explain the feature.__ The more details here, the better chance we have of implementing the feature as described.
* __Explain why the feature is necessary and the benefits it provides to most users.___
* __Provide the OS, OS version, PHP version, and environment you are currently using.__ This helps us with testing in foreign environments (outside our own).
* __Anything else that may be relevant to the feature requests.__ There is no such thing as too much detail, only incomprehensible detail.

or better yet, use this template, replace everything in braces (`[]`) with the information requested:

#### Feature request template
```
[Brief summary of the feature...]

### Suggested behavior

  including references to other libraries that implement the feature, 
  suggested implementations, pull requests, etc...]

## Pull requests
At the moment we are not accepting pull request from outside the organization. Once we release the initial alpha release, we will.
